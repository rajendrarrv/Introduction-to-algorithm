## 1. Role of Algorithm in computing 

### Excercise 1.0 

[ ] Give a real world example  that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull

[ ]  Other than speed  what other measures of efficeincy might  one use in a real-world setting? 

[ ]  Select a data structure  that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations 

[ ] How are the shortest-path  and travelling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they are different? 

[ ] Come up with a real-world problem  in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which  a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough. 

### Excercise 1.2 

[ ] Give an example  of an application that requires algorithms content at the application level and discuss the function of the algorithms involved. 

[ ] Suppose we are comparing  implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs  of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n^2^ steps, while merge sort runs in 64n lg n steps. For which  values  of n does insertion sort beat merge sort? 

[ ] What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2^ runs faster than an algorithm whose runing time is 2^n^ on the same machine. 
## Problems 

### Comparison  of running times

For each function f(n) and time t in the following table, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem  takes f(n) microseconds.

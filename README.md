## 1. Role of Algorithm in computing 

### Excercise 1.0 

[ ] Give a real world example  that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull

[ ]  Other than speed  what other measures of efficeincy might  one use in a real-world setting? 

[ ]  Select a data structure  that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations 

[ ] How are the shortest-path  and travelling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they are different? 

[ ] Come up with a real-world problem  in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which  a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.
